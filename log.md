# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Daily Coding Problem #1 - find if a pair of elements from an array result in a target sum.

**Thoughts** Focusing on probelm solving skills, used set data structure in Python.

### Day 2: August 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Daily Coding Problem #2 - return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i

**Thoughts** The division method was straighforward, took some time understanding left/right algorithm, and finally optimized for O(1)
